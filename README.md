Currently people are preferring sugarless food to sugar content food. These precautions are taken to prevent diabetes in their blood.
The count of diabetes patients are increasing  in the recent period. Machine learning algorithms are used for predicting the diabetes positive patient. 
Past data of the patients such as Pregnancies, Insulin, BMI, Age etc. are used for predicting the patient is positive or not. 
The use of ML models for forecasting the outputs in the medical fields will create ease of resource development. Hospitals are developing according to generations. 
The change in the hospital fields with the help of artificial intelligence will create the best resourceful development in the medical fields,
Everything around us is having its development in artificial intelligence. 
The first objective of this work is to develop predictive models for diagnosing diabetes in patients using various machine learning algorithms. 
Specifically, we employed Multiple Logistic Regression (MLR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Na√Øve Bayes, Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models.

Use the desired file for the analysis purpose. If you need normalised data then use diabetes_norm.csv. 
else use the actual file for the values
